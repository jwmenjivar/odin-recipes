The current project has been designed to test my habilities as for basic web development insights obtained in the odin project foundations section.

It consists of building a website about recipes using html and css styling.

It is not expected to look fantastic, since css learning is at a basic level. Some grid and some flexbox at a max.
After all, it looks kind of nice.
